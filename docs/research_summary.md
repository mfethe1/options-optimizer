# Research Summary (Rounds 1-4)

High-level synthesis of pricing models, sentiment integration, neural architectures, and open-source tools for the options probability calculator. See conversation notes for details.

- Round 1: Heston/SABR/local vol, jump-diffusion, IV surface fitting, RND extraction, calibration.
- Round 2: Sentiment (FinBERT), event studies, nowcasting, leakage prevention, labels for realized vol and IV shifts.
- Round 3: TFT/TCN forecasters, GAN/VAEs for scenarios, PINNs, Deep Hedging; robust training/backtesting.
- Round 4: Data APIs (yfinance, Polygon/IEX), QuantLib/py_vollib, transformers, scikit-learn/PyTorch.
