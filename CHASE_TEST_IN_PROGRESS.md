# Chase Integration Test - IN PROGRESS

## 🔄 **Current Status: Testing Authentication**

The Chase integration test is currently running. Here's what's happening:

### **✅ Setup Complete**

- ✅ Fixed import issues (changed from `chaseinvest_api` to `chase`)
- ✅ Fixed playwright-stealth compatibility (downgraded to v1.0.5)
- ✅ Updated test script to use correct API (ChaseSession, AllAccount, SymbolHoldings, SymbolQuote)
- ✅ Created profile directory for browser session
- ✅ Loaded credentials from `.env` file

### **🌐 Browser Window**

A Chromium browser window should have opened with the Chase login page. The script is attempting to:

1. Navigate to Chase.com
2. Enter username: `fethe591`
3. Enter password: (from `.env`)
4. Handle MFA if required

### **⏳ What to Expect**

**If MFA is required**:
- You'll see a prompt in the console asking for the code
- Check your phone for a text message from Chase
- Enter the code when prompted
- Script will continue after verification

**If login succeeds**:
- Script will fetch account information
- Script will retrieve portfolio holdings
- Script will get real-time quotes
- Results will be saved to JSON files

### **📊 Test Steps**

1. **STEP 1: Authentication** (IN PROGRESS)
   - Creating Chase session
   - Logging in to Chase.com
   - Handling MFA if needed

2. **STEP 2: Fetch Holdings** (PENDING)
   - Get all account IDs
   - Fetch account details
   - Retrieve positions (stocks, options, cash)

3. **STEP 3: Fetch Quotes** (PENDING)
   - Get real-time pricing for held symbols
   - Extract bid/ask/last prices

4. **STEP 4: Save Results** (PENDING)
   - Save holdings to JSON
   - Save quotes to JSON
   - Display summary

### **🔍 What We're Testing**

**Critical Questions**:
1. ✅ Can we create a Chase session?
2. ⏳ Can we authenticate with username/password?
3. ❓ Does MFA work properly?
4. ❓ Can we fetch account information?
5. ❓ Can we retrieve portfolio holdings?
6. ❓ **Are options positions included?** (KEY QUESTION)
7. ❓ Can we get real-time quotes?
8. ❓ Is the data accurate?

### **⚠️ Important Notes**

**Browser Window**:
- Must stay open during the entire test
- Don't close it manually
- Script will close it when done

**MFA**:
- If prompted, check your phone for code
- Enter code in console when asked
- Code is usually 6 digits

**Timeout**:
- Script will wait up to 10 minutes
- If it takes longer, something may be wrong

### **📁 Expected Output Files**

After successful completion:
- `chase_holdings_TIMESTAMP.json` - Your portfolio positions
- `chase_quotes_TIMESTAMP.json` - Real-time pricing data

### **🆘 If Something Goes Wrong**

**Browser doesn't open**:
- Check if Chromium is installed: `python -m playwright install chromium`

**Login fails**:
- Verify credentials in `.env` file
- Check if Chase is blocking automated access
- Try logging in manually first

**MFA doesn't work**:
- Make sure you enter the code quickly (they expire)
- Check that you're entering the correct code
- Try requesting a new code

**Script hangs**:
- Check the browser window for prompts
- Look for error messages in console
- Press Ctrl+C to cancel if needed

### **📝 Next Steps After Test**

**If test succeeds**:
1. Review the JSON files
2. Verify data accuracy
3. Check if options are included
4. Build Chase integration service
5. Integrate with recommendation engine

**If test fails**:
1. Review error messages
2. Check troubleshooting steps
3. Try manual login first
4. Consider alternative approaches
