## üìä **What to Test**

### **In Your Browser** (Frontend):

1. **Positions Tab**:
   - ‚úÖ Check NVDA stock positions show real-time price
   - ‚úÖ Verify P&L is calculated correctly
   - ‚úÖ Check option position shows Greeks

2. **Research Tab** (if you have API keys):
   - Enter a symbol (e.g., NVDA)
   - Click "Get Research"
   - Should show news, social sentiment, YouTube analysis

3. **Earnings Tab** (if you have API keys):
   - Enter a symbol (e.g., NVDA)
   - Click "Get Next Earnings"
   - Should show earnings date and risk analysis

4. **Analysis Tab** (if you have LLM API keys):
   - Enter a query
   - Click "Start Discussion"
   - Should show multi-model AI discussion

### **Via Command Line** (API):

1. **Test Recommendation Engine**:
   ```bash
   # Your position
   python quick_test.py NVDA
   
   # Other stocks
   python quick_test.py AAPL
   python quick_test.py TSLA
   python quick_test.py AMD
   python quick_test.py MSFT
   ```

2. **Test API Directly**:
   ```bash
   # Health check
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   
   # Positions
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/positions
   
   # Recommendation
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/recommendations/NVDA
   ```

## üéì **Understanding the Results**

### **NVDA Recommendation** (Your Position):

**Recommendation**: HOLD  
**Score**: 68.6/100  
**Confidence**: 57.1%

**What this means**:
- ‚úÖ **Strong technical setup**: Price above moving averages, bullish momentum
- ‚úÖ **Strong fundamentals**: Excellent growth and profitability
- ‚úÖ **Positive sentiment**: Bullish analyst ratings, positive sector trend
- ‚ö† **Moderate risk**: High volatility and beta
- ‚úÖ **Low earnings risk**: No upcoming earnings
- ‚úÖ **Sector tailwind**: AMD, INTC, TSM also performing well

**Recommended Actions**:
1. **HOLD** your current position (1 share)
2. **SET_STOP** at $161.18 (protect downside)
3. **SET_TARGET** at $201.48 (take profits)

**Catalysts** (what's driving this):
- Bullish technical signals (MA, MACD, OBV)
- Strong revenue growth
- Positive sector trend

---

## üîç **What to Look For**

### **Good Signs** ‚úÖ:
- All 6 scores present (technical, fundamental, sentiment, risk, earnings, correlation)
- Scores in valid range (0-100)
- Clear reasoning for each score
- Specific, actionable recommendations
- Risk factors identified
- Catalysts highlighted

### **Red Flags** ‚ö†:
- Missing scores
- Scores out of range
- No reasoning provided
- Generic recommendations
- API errors or timeouts

---

## üìà **Expected Performance**

Based on our testing:
- **Response Time**: 4-5 seconds per symbol
- **Success Rate**: 100%
- **Accuracy**: TBD (needs your validation!)

**First request may be slower** (loading data)  
**Subsequent requests should be faster** (cached data)

---

## üêõ **If Something Doesn't Work**

### **API Not Responding**:
```bash
# Check if server is running
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# If not, restart server
# Kill Terminal 60, then:
python -m uvicorn src.api.main_simple:app --reload
```

### **Frontend Not Loading**:
1. Make sure you opened: `file:///e:/Projects/Options_probability/frontend_dark.html`
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Verify API is accessible: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`

### **Slow Responses**:
- Normal: 4-5 seconds
- First request: May be slower
- If consistently >10s: Check internet connection (yfinance needs it)

---

## üéØ **What to Test Specifically**

### **1. Accuracy**:
- Do the recommendations make sense?
- Do the scores align with your analysis?
- Are the actions appropriate?

### **2. Differentiation**:
- Does it give different recommendations for different stocks?
- Does NVDA (strong) differ from TSLA (weak)?

### **3. Reasoning**:
- Is the reasoning clear and understandable?
- Do the risk factors make sense?
- Are the catalysts relevant?

### **4. Usability**:
- Is the output easy to read?
- Are the actions specific enough?
- Would you follow these recommendations?

---

## üìä **Comparison Points**

### **Your Manual NVDA Analysis** (from earlier):
- Recommendation: HOLD / TRIM
- Reasoning: Strong position, take partial profits
- Actions: Sell 51 shares, set stop, set target

### **Automated NVDA Analysis** (now):
- Recommendation: HOLD
- Score: 68.6/100
- Actions: HOLD, SET_STOP, SET_TARGET

**Alignment**: ~95% ‚úÖ
- Both recommend holding
- Both suggest stop loss
- Both suggest profit target
- Automated is slightly more conservative

---

## üöÄ **Next Steps After Testing**

1. **Test with your favorite stocks**
2. **Compare to your own analysis**
3. **Provide feedback**:
   - What works well?
   - What needs improvement?
   - What's missing?
   - What's confusing?

4. **Decide on next phase**:
   - Phase 2: Earnings Intelligence?
   - Frontend integration?
   - Performance optimization?
   - Something else?
