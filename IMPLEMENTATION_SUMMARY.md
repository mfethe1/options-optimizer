## 🏗️ Architecture Design

### Tier 8: Distillation Agent

**Role**: Synthesize outputs from all 17 agents into cohesive investor narratives

**Responsibilities**:
1. Gather high-priority insights from all agents
2. Deduplicate redundant analysis
3. Categorize insights (bullish/bearish/risk/opportunity)
4. Generate narrative sections via LLM
5. Structure output for investor consumption

**Temperature**: 0.7 (creative synthesis)
**Priority**: 10 (highest)
**LLM**: Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic)

### Temperature Profiles by Tier

```python
TIER_TEMPERATURES = {
    1: 0.3,  # Oversight & Coordination (focused, deterministic)
    2: 0.5,  # Market Intelligence (balanced)
    3: 0.4,  # Fundamental & Macro (analytical)
    4: 0.6,  # Risk & Sentiment (exploratory)
    5: 0.5,  # Options & Volatility (balanced)
    6: 0.2,  # Execution & Compliance (highly deterministic)
    7: 0.7,  # Recommendation Engine (creative synthesis)
    8: 0.7   # Distillation (creative synthesis) ⭐ NEW
}
```

### Deduplication Strategy

**Method**: Content hashing with MD5
**Storage**: Set of message hashes in SharedContext
**Logic**: Reject messages with duplicate content hashes
**Tracking**: Topic coverage per agent to identify gaps

### Context Engineering

**Approach**: Agents query SharedContext before analyzing
**Information Provided**:
- Topics already covered by other agents
- Key insights from high-priority messages
- Uncovered topics to focus on

**Result**: Agents avoid redundant work and fill gaps

---

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

### Redundancy Reduction
- **Target**: <10% duplicate insights across agents
- **Measurement**: Count of rejected duplicate messages
- **Benefit**: Faster analysis, lower token costs

### Output Diversity
- **Target**: Shannon entropy >0.7 across agent outputs
- **Measurement**: Entropy calculation on agent perspectives
- **Benefit**: Comprehensive coverage of all angles

### Investor Readability
- **Target**: Flesch-Kincaid grade level 10-12
- **Measurement**: Readability analysis on narrative output
- **Benefit**: Accessible to professional investors

### Synthesis Quality
- **Target**: >80% of insights incorporated into narrative
- **Measurement**: Coverage analysis of agent insights
- **Benefit**: No valuable insights lost in synthesis

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### From Research
1. **Context Engineering is Critical**: Agents must be aware of collective knowledge
2. **Temperature Matters**: Different roles need different creativity levels
3. **Deduplication is Essential**: Prevents wasted tokens and redundant work
4. **Investor-Friendly ≠ Technical**: Narrative synthesis is a distinct skill
5. **Sections Must Be Adaptive**: Different investors need different information

### From Design Process
1. **Start with Research**: Best practices inform better architecture
2. **Plan Before Coding**: Comprehensive design saves implementation time
3. **Document Thoroughly**: Future developers (and users) will thank you
4. **Think in Phases**: Break large projects into manageable chunks
5. **Measure Success**: Define metrics before implementation
