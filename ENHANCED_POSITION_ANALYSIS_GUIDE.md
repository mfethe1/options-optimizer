## 🔍 **HOW IT WORKS**

### **1. Stock-Specific Text Extraction**

The system parses each agent's full LLM response to extract sections mentioning the specific stock:

```python
def _extract_stock_specific_text(symbol: str, llm_response: str) -> str:
    """
    Extract stock-specific sections from LLM response.
    
    Looks for sections that mention the symbol and extracts surrounding context.
    """
    # Finds all mentions of symbol (e.g., "NVDA")
    # Extracts surrounding context (2 lines before, all lines until next section)
    # Returns assembled stock-specific text
```

**Example Input** (from Fundamental Analyst):
```
**Market Analysis**

The tech sector is showing strong momentum...

**NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)**
- Market Cap: $1.2T | P/E: 45x | Revenue Growth: 40% YoY
- **Financial Health**: Exceptional. $29B cash, minimal debt
- **Earnings Quality**: High. Revenue growth driven by AI demand
- **Competitive Moat**: Dominant 85% market share in AI accelerators
- **Valuation**: Premium but justified. DCF suggests $160-180
- **Rating**: STRONG BUY - Best-in-class fundamentals

**Amazon.com (AMZN)**
- Market Cap: $1.8T | P/E: 38x...
```

**Example Output** (for NVDA):
```
**NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)**
- Market Cap: $1.2T | P/E: 45x | Revenue Growth: 40% YoY
- **Financial Health**: Exceptional. $29B cash, minimal debt
- **Earnings Quality**: High. Revenue growth driven by AI demand
- **Competitive Moat**: Dominant 85% market share in AI accelerators
- **Valuation**: Premium but justified. DCF suggests $160-180
- **Rating**: STRONG BUY - Best-in-class fundamentals
```

### **2. Structured Metrics Extraction**

The system uses regex patterns to extract structured metrics from the text:

```python
def _extract_stock_metrics(symbol: str, llm_response: str, agent_type: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Extract structured metrics for a specific stock from LLM response.
    
    Different agent types provide different metrics:
    - Fundamental: P/E, revenue growth, margins, moat
    - Market: momentum, technical levels, volume
    - Risk: volatility, correlation, max drawdown
    - Sentiment: sentiment score, news tone
    """
```

**Extraction Functions:**
- `_extract_number()` - Extracts numbers (e.g., "P/E: 45" → 45.0)
- `_extract_percentage()` - Extracts percentages (e.g., "Revenue Growth: 40%" → 40.0)
- `_extract_market_cap()` - Extracts market cap (e.g., "$1.2T")
- `_extract_rating()` - Extracts ratings (e.g., "STRONG BUY")
- `_extract_valuation()` - Extracts valuation (e.g., "undervalued", "fair", "overvalued")
- `_extract_momentum()` - Extracts momentum (e.g., "strong_bullish", "bearish")
- `_extract_risk_level()` - Extracts risk (e.g., "high", "moderate", "low")
- `_extract_sentiment()` - Extracts sentiment (e.g., "very_positive", "negative")

### **3. Comprehensive Stock Report Assembly**

The system assembles insights from all agents into a unified report:

```python
def _build_comprehensive_stock_report(
    symbol: str,
    position_insights: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    agent_insights: List[Dict[str, Any]]
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Build comprehensive stock report by assembling insights from all agents.
    
    This creates a unified view of what all agents think about this specific stock.
    """
```

**Process:**
1. **Categorize Agents** - Group by fundamental, market/technical, risk, sentiment, macro, volatility
2. **Extract Category Analysis** - For each category, collect all agent insights
3. **Build Category Summary** - Calculate consensus (e.g., "Bullish (3/3 agents recommend BUY)")
4. **Aggregate Metrics** - Average numeric metrics, take mode for categorical
5. **Assemble Full Text** - Combine all stock-specific text into comprehensive report

### **4. Replacement Recommendations**

The new **LLMRecommendationAgent** analyzes each position and suggests alternatives:

**Recommendation Criteria:**
- **Price Matching**: Within ±20% of current position value
- **Higher Probability of Return**: Based on fundamentals, technicals, catalysts
- **Lower Risk**: Better risk/reward ratio
- **Diversification**: Avoid recommending same ticker multiple times
- **Market Conditions**: Consider VIX and sentiment

**Recommendations Include:**
- **Stock Alternative**: Direct stock purchase with similar dollar value
- **Option Alternative**: Option position with similar delta and pricing
